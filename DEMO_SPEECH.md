# ZeroPlate - 3 Minute Demo Speech

## Opening Hook (15 seconds)
"Every day, college mess halls across India waste **thousands of kilograms** of perfectly good food—while millions go hungry. What if we could bridge this gap with technology? Meet **ZeroPlate**—the smart platform turning campus food waste into community impact."

---

## The Problem (30 seconds)
"In Indian colleges, mess halls serve hundreds of students daily. But here's the challenge:
- **Overproduction** leads to massive food waste
- **No real-time tracking** of what's being wasted
- **Zero connection** to NGOs who could use that excess food
- **Students' feedback** gets lost in paperwork

The result? Food ends up in the trash instead of feeding those in need."
